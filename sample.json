        " There's no fossil record of viruses in the conventional sense they're just too small and fragile to be preserved in rock but there are fossils of viruses of sorts preserved in the dna of the host that they've infected including you . This molecular fossil trail can help us understand where viruses came from and how they evolved with the rest of us . The key to the virus' success is their simplicity in general in general they consists of a bit of genetic information either dna or rna wrapped in a capsule of protein . Some scientists think that they evolved alongside or even before the earliest cells but without real fossils how can we know the history of viruses enter the science of paleovorology this is a young field within paleontology because it's built on another emerging field genomics in order to look for traces of ancient viruses experts have to study the genomes of their hosts .

        " The genome of the virus can become integrated into the dna of the host and as long as it doesn't cause a mutation that damages the host cell that bit of viral information may stay there indefinitely . If this happens in a cell that forms sperm or eggs then the viral genome can actually be inherited passed onto the host's offspring with the rest of its genome . Scientists can use this to help figure out the age of virus fossils and they do it the same way they study the evolution of other genes by lining up comparable sequences from different organisms and comparing them . If a sequence of viral dna is found in two different animals then they probably both got it from a common ancestor and that means the virus has to be at least as old as that ancestor so for example circo viruses are a group of viruses that are known to cosomic problems and dogs and scientists and scientists once got it to cosomomics problems and the dogs and dogs are once scientists once had to agree to understand the origin of these viruses",
        " traces of viruses have been found in the genomes of dogs and also cats and even pandas so the viruses must aid back to before those mammals last year to common ancestor which might be as much as sixty eight million years ago in the late cretaceous period . Eight percent of the human genome includes sequences that originally came from viruses so paleoverology has helped us state the evolution of viruses back hundreds of millions of years but that doesn't bring as much closer to when we think viruses first originated billions of years ago now there are few different models for where viruses came from and they're still hotly debated by scientists so just be prepared if you pick aside one model is known as the virus first model annette holds that since viruses are so much simpler than cellular life it must have evolved first this would mean that viruses are older than the oldest single celled organisms . One model holds that viruses were so much simple than cell life it means that viruses must have evolve first and that viruses is older than that of the oldest cellular life and that would mean",
        " The escape hypothesis suggests that viruses evolved after sales did from within their own genes b c r genomes contain pieces that can actually copy and paste themselves from one part of our dna to another so some experts think that if one of those pieces becomes able to make itself a nice code protein it can easily escape the cell and become a virus . The third model hinges on the discovery of so called giant viruses the first one discovered in two thousand and three was named mim virus short for mimicking microbe and these things are huge by virus standards they're about seven hundred and fifty nanometers across that's bigger than some bacteria now fortunately they only infect amoeba sweet enough to worry about them at least yet now mimy viruses have way more genes than normal viruses do including some genes that can be used to make protein which viruses are not supposed to do but Mimy viruses still depend on their host to reproduce . Some scientists argue that the extra genes are just random leftovers that are picked up from his hosts over the eons . paleovorology",
        " The answer depends a lot on who you ask whether viruses are alive or if they have a place on the tree of life . Some scientists are content to put viruses in a sort of gray area of semi-living things . Others are determined to figure out whether viruses occupy their own branch of life and if so they might be thought of as like vines that wrap around it . But either way viruses are here they're in our dna they make us sick sometimes very badly so there's no denying that they have an place and a greater picture of what life on earth is like for good or for ill thanks to curiosity stream for continuing to support pbs digital studios with curiosity stream you can stream documentary films and programs about science nature and history including curiosity's dream originals including rapidly evolving human which explores how changes to our genetic code have made us who we are today and why they continue to evolve you can learn more at curiosity stream com eons and when you sign up use the code eons"

        "the thanks to a curiosity stream for supporting pbs digital studios the earth never shook beneath their feet we've never found their remains in the rocks and by some standards they're not even alive they're just bits of protein and genetic information that might give you a sniffle for a couple of days or worse but they're also proof that even the very smallest things can have an outsized impact on the history of life i'm talking of course about those tiny genetic burglars that you've been asking about for so long viruses there's no fossil record of viruses in the conventional sense they're just too small and fragile to be preserved in rock but there are fossils of viruses of sorts preserved in the dna of the host that they've infected including you and yet i mean to some extent i guess but this molecular fossil trail can help us understand where viruses came from and how they evolved with the rest of us and it can even help us tackle the biggest question of all our viruses alive the key to the virus' success is their simplicity in general they consists of a bit of genetic information either dna or rna wrapped in a capsule of protein many are small of course on the order of tens of nanometers while others are surprisingly big but they all rely on infecting some sort of host to reproduce and survive we think that viruses have been around as long as life itself partly because they can infect all forms of life archia you carry and because they're so simple some scientists think that they evolved alongside or even before the earliest cells but without real fossils how can we know the history of viruses enter the science of paleovorology this is a young field within paleontology because it's built on another emerging field genomics in order to look for traces of ancient viruses experts have to study the genomes of their",
        "hosts it makes sense when you think about how viruses actually work viruses have to infect a host cell to access the machinery that it uses to replicate his dna and then hijack that machinery in order to reproduce which is like when i say that allowed such a scumbag move the host cell is forced to manufacture new viruses which then leave and look for new host to infect except the viruses and the hosts don't always exactly part ways entirely sometimes the genome of the virus can become integrated into the dna of the host and as long as it doesn't cause a mutation that damages the host cell that bit of viral information may stay there indefinitely and if this happens in a cell that forms sperm or eggs then the viral genome can actually be inherited passed onto the host's offspring with the rest of its genome so in this way the viral genome becomes a sort of molecular fossil and those ancient bits of viral information can also shed light on how old viruses are that's because ordinarily viruses change really quickly that's why you have to get a new flu shot every year a virus mutates so fast that after a few hundred years not much of the original genome may be left however if that dna is integrated into its host then it can only mutate as fast as the house does and since hosts reproduce more slowly than viruses do their mutation rate is lower too all this means that the viral gene will be preserved though not perfectly for way longer than a virus is just floating around out there on its own now scientists can use this to help figure out the age of virus fossils and they do it the same way they study the evolution of other genes by lining up comparable sequences from different organisms and comparing them if a sequence of viral dna is found in two different animals then they probably both got it from a common ancestor and that means the virus has to be at least as old as that ancestor so for example circo viruses are a group of viruses that are known to cosomic problems and dogs and scientists once",
