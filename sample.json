sealed glass laboratory scientists here are engineering special chips that could power the next computing revolution a universal quantum computer chances are you've heard of quantum computers and that they're going to change everything quantum computers have the potential to completely change how we use technology of the teacher the computational power is off the charts what's about to happen with quantum computing is going to make the past look incredibly slow quantum computers are new kinds of machines that promise an exponential growth in processing power capable of tackling problems our computers today can't solve an encryption busting global problem solving quantum computer doesn't exist just yet the field has gained some serious momentum we've reached a point where it's pretty clear that those performance numbers are good enough now you could build a real product a real piece of technology out of this idea and when that threshold got crossed people started to place their beds tech giants like ibm and google and startups like brigade computing are all in something of a scientific race to build the first universal quantum computer but to fully understand what makes a quantum computer so uniquely powerful you'll need to know a bit of quantum mechanics quantum mechanics is the field that describes the simplest things around us individual electrons or atoms or particles of light like photons and the fascinating thing is when you look at these very simple systems they don't really obey the same rules that the world around us does we use sort of two very important properties of quantum mechanics one of them is superposition of states and the other one is", "entanglement when we talk about classical computing we often hear the word bit and bit can refer to zero and one you can also think of it as a binary state you have a switch give me honor can be off for instance when you're physically typing commands into your computer to write an email each letter you strike on the keyboard is translated to a unique string of zeros and ones that are being switched on and off to digitally represent your words but with superposition quantum computers can do things differently instead of using these bits via zero or ones we use what's called qubits which are quantum bits in these bits instead of being a zero or one can neither be sort of any combination of a zero under one this is something that sort of arises because of quantum mechanics but it allows us to do more tricks now there's a very special form of superposition known as entanglements which is even more interesting what you have is the ability to have two qubits in superposition states that essentially can only be understood with a collective element of both qubits in a quantum computer you can use that lingering interaction to do all sorts of really interesting types of calculations where different qubits have this kind of persistent ghostly connection with each other and if you put this stupid around this one over here we'll feel it and if you do that in a controlled way you can move lots and lots of information around within your point mechanical system really efficiently but controlling qubits and constructing the right quantum architecture are today's major engineering challenges which is why quantum computers in the labs that house them today look like this white where computers were in the fifties or forties or where you had technicians plugging and unplugging things all over the place on some wall electricity", "you want things when you're first building them to be really modular and reconfigurable to build a quantum computer you need to start with the quantum chip and rage ibm and other tech companies are investing in something called superconducting qubits a supercontinent is just metal on a silicon ship and that metal on the second ship is arranged in such a way that when you cool it down to a low enough temperature that the metal becomes superconnecting and that is all the electrons can flow without electrical resistance they can actually take on individual quantum states the need thing about supercontinent cubits is you can make them with just normal semiconductor processes we finished making this way further six inches and size got this big there's typically anywhere between a few dozen to a few hundred chips and they get packaged into a circuit board that lets us make connections onto that ship when you're making circuits on silicon you have to have the environment be really free of dust and containing this because we have very small features on these chips and a piece of dust can screw them up in order to cool them down you need an entire infrastructure of refrigeration and so for that we rely on what are known as delusion refrigerators these solution refrigerators allow us to cool down the chips to around ten to fifteen milly calvin the most noticeable sound you hear in our labs is the cryocores they work by pulsing helium gas into and out of this refrigerator system in such a way that's just continuously drawing heat out of the interior of the fridge besides the refrigerator there's an entire suite of hardware components and coaxio cables attenuators microwave amplifiers circulators a whole bevy of components that are all need to function at low temperatures to enable our", "quantum processors in order to sort of control the cubits we have a lot of hardware that sends pulses and signals to the qubits we use this thing which we call a resonator which is sort of sensitive to the state of the cubit and it is a way for us to kind of read and see the state of the cubit we like to say it's like a middleman its state will change depending on the state of the cubit and we can sort of read it and talk to it more easily than we can talk to the cubit though the teams have different approaches they're respectively finessing their techniques tweaking the intensity of microwave pulses in temperature manufacturing different kinds of quantum chips and testing new algorithms there's a lot of work to do because at this stage the amount of time acute that can retain its quantumness is still pretty short the single biggest challenge all the time is always how do you make these cubists last as long as possible coherent times is how long quantum information lasts inside of a cubit so if you put a cupboard from this to the one state and you just wait hundreds two hundred microseconds at some point that extra little bit of energy will decay out of tubital of the noise that we actually have in physical systems results in error rates that are still not quite good enough to perform these proven quantum algorithms in a head to head match between quantum computers and classical computers today our laptops still dominate at least for now today's quantum computers aren't big enough or high performing enough to actually do something better than a classical computer that's going to change pretty soon an example of this is it is basically impossible for a computer to anticipate what a molecule would do in the human body this is something that", "drug development industry has to spend billions of dollars figuring out by just guessing and checking nature doesn't store information and zeros and once the operating system of nature is quantum mechanics if you want to simulate a quantum system you need something that can do it mechanically and so that's the kind of problem that a quantum computer can solve because quantum computers can analyze large quantities of data and spot patterns quickly they could tackle optimization problems for transportation and industry advanced climate modeling and boost artificial intelligence research one day but for those wondering when they'll be able to pick up a quantum laptop you won't have sort of a personal laptop that is a quantum computer will be a little bit more behind the scenes quantum computers are still in the experimental stage but their raw potential and imminent arrival are sure to cause a paradigm shift in computing physics and potentially our understanding of the world we live in today you're working on an extremely challenging and hard problem more every day you're thinking about really hard physics sort of debugging experiments working with hardware writing a lot of code collaborating much like the development of classical computers where no one would have probably predicted where we are today with the technology that emerge from classical computers such as with our mobile phones laptops that it's really hard for us to even predict what are going to be the offshoot technologies whereas quantum computing actually going to bring us into the future for more science documentaries
