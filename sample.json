    "what you're looking at is a hermetically seal glass laboratory scientists here engineering special chips that could powerwer the next computing revolution a universal quantum computer chances are you've heard of quantum computers and that they 're going to change everything quant some computes have the potentialshes are comte change how we use technology and the future the computational power is off the charards what's about to happen with quantum computing is going to make the past look credibly slow quantum computers are new kinds of machines that promise an exponential grow spper in processing power capable of tackling problems are computers today can't solve while in encryption busting global problem solving quantum computer doesn 't exist just yet the field is gain some serious momentum we reach a point where it 's pretty clear that those performce bers are good up now you can build a real product a real piece of technology out of this idea and when that that threshold got cross people start place their bed tech giants like ibm and gogle and startups like forrigetting computing are all in something of a scientific race to build the first universal quantum computer but to fully understand what makes a quantum computer so uniquely powerful you'll need to know a bit of quantum mechanics quant mechanics is the feelield that discrib the simplest things around us individual electrons or atoms or particles of way like photonns and the fascinating is when you look at these very simple systems don't really obey the same rules that that the world around us does we use sort of two very important properties of quantum mechanics one of them is toperposition of states and the other one is entanglement when we talk about classical computing you often here the word bit and bit can refer to zero and one you can also think of it as a binary state you have a switch can be onor can be off for instance when you're physically typing commands into your computer to write an email each letter you strike on the keyboard is translated to a unique string of zero in ones that are being switched on in off to digitally represent your words but with superposition quantum computers can do things differently andinstead of using these bits zero are ones we use what's called cubbits which are quantumbits and these bits instead of being a zero or a one can now there be sort of any combination of a zero and one this is something that sort of arises because of quantum mechanics and allows us to g sort of more tricks now there's a very special form of superposition known as entanglement which is even more interesting what you have is the ability to have two cubits in superposition states that essentially can only be understood with a collective element of both cubits and a quantum puter you can use that lingering interaction to do all sorts of really interesting pes of calculations where different cubbits have this kind of persistent gostly connection with each other and if you foot this cub around this one over here o feel and if you do that the controlled way you can move what and wants information around in your quum counil system really position but controll ing cubbits and constructing the right quantum architecture are today's major engineering challenges which is why quantum computers in the labs that has them today look like this it's right where computers were in the fifties or forties that where you had technicians pluging and un plugging things you all over the place on some wall of electronics you want things when you're first building them to be really modular reconfigurable to build a quantum computer you need to start with the quantum chip and rerigetty ibm and other tech comanies are investing in something called super conducting cubbits a c per i give it is just metal on a silicon ship and that meal the sil ship is rangange in such a way that when you cool it down to alone up temperature that the metal becomes superconneducting and that is all the electrons have flow without electral resistance they can actually take on individual quantum states the thing of super p cubits is you can you can make them with just normal semic conductor processes finish make and as way further six inches and size about this big there's typically anywhere between a few dozen to a few hundred chips and they get packaged into a circit board that that is the connections on to that ship when you re making circuits on silicon you have to have the environmentally really free of dust ing comanment because we have very small features on this chips and these a ust conscrw them up in order to cool them down you need an entire infrastructure of refrigeration and so for that we rely on what or known as delution or frigerators these delution or frigerators allow us to cool down the chips to around ten to fifteen reallyly coing the most noticeable sound you're here in our labs is the cryum fors they work by pulsing fillum gas into and out of this refrigerator system and such way that is continuously drawing heat out of the interior of the fridge besides the refrigerator there's an entire sweet of hard workin and coxial cables tenuators micro ampifiers circulators whole bevy of the onents that are all need the function at low temperers to enable or quantum processers in order to sort of control that cubits we have a lot of hardware that sends pulses and signals to the cubits we use the thing which we call a resonator which is sort of sensitive to the state of the cuba and is a way for us to kind of read and see the state of the cuba we like to sayit 's like a middle man and its state will change depend on the stand a cuba and we can sort of read it and talkp to it more easily that we can talk to the cubit though the team of different approaches the respectively the nessing their techniques tweaking the intensity of micwave pses in temperature manufacturing different kinds of quantum chips and testing new algorithms there 's a lot of work to do because if this stage the amount of time cubit can retain its quantumness is still pretty short the single biggest challenge all the time is always how do you make these cubits last as long as possible who here timesence as how long quantum information lasts inside of accubit so if you put a cub from the er a to the one state and you just wait hundred microct two under micro seconds at some point that extra little bit energy will the ay out of the cubbit all of the noise that we actually have in physical systems results in erorrates that are still not quite good enough to perform these provenin quantum algorithms in a head to head match between quantum computers and classical computers today our laptop still dominate at least for now the ' quantum computers 't big enough or high performing enough to actually do something better than a classical comer that's going to change pretty soon an example of this is it is basically impossible for a computer to anticipate what a mo cu would do in the human body this is something that the drug development industry has a spend billions of dollars figuringing out by just guessing and checking nature doesn't store information and zero and ones the operating system of nature quantum mechanics if you want to simulate a quantum system you need something that can do it quantum mechanic and so that's the the kind of problem that quantum can solve because quantum computers can analyze large quantities of data in spot patterns quickly they could tech le optimization problems for transportation and industry advance climate modeling and boost artificial intelligence research one day but for those wondering when they ll be able to pick up a quantum laptoup and you want 't have sort of a personal laptop that is a quantum computer a quantum computer will be a little bit more behind the scene quantum computers are still the experimental stage but raw potential and imminate arrival are sure to cause a paradig 'm shifting computing physics and potentially are understanding of the world we live in today 're working on and extremely challenging and hard problem where every day thinking about really hard physics sort of de bugging experiment working with hardware are writing a lot of code collaborating much like the development of class room puters where no one would have probably predicted where we are today with the technologies that emerge from classical puter such as with our ble bile phones laptops that iss really hard first even predict what are going to be the offshoe technologies where as quantum computing actually going to bring us into the future for more sunit' documentaries cheick this one right here don 't forget to subscribe and keep
