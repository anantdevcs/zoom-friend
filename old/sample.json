Quantum computers promise an exponential growth in processing power capable of tackling problems our computers today can't solve an encryption busting global problem solving quantum computer doesn't exist just yet . We've reached a point where it's pretty clear that those performance numbers are good enough now you could build a real product a real piece of technology out of this idea and when that threshooo is reached, we'll see a quantum computer that can solve encryption . Tech giants like ibm and google and startups like brigade computing are all in a scientific race to build the first universal quantum computer . To fully understand what makes a quantum computer so uniquely powerful you'll need to know a bit of quantum mechanics . The field describes the simplest things around us individual electrons or atoms or particles of light like photons . The fascinating thing is when you look at these very simple systems they don't really obey the same rules that the world around us does we use sort of two very important properties of quantum ."}
